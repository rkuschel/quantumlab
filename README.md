# Quantum-Safe Dev Environment Scripts

This repository contains automation scripts for setting up a Docker-based OpenSSL 3 development environment with post-quantum cryptography (PQC) support, using the `openquantumsafe/oqs-ossl3` image.  
Both Linux/macOS (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell) versions are provided.

The environment includes:

- OpenSSL 3 with ML-KEM and Dilithium PQC algorithms
- Apache HTTP server with TLS enabled
- Automatic generation of a hybrid post-quantum certificate at container startup
- Optional interactive shell inside the container for development and testing

## Repository Structure

/
├── bash/
│ ├── 1.sh # Builds image and runs container interactively
│ └── 2.sh # Same as above but with inline comments for learning/reference
│
└── Windows/
├── 1.ps1 # PowerShell version of build + run script
└── 2.ps1 # Commented version for Windows users

| Folder | OS / Shell | Contents |
|--------|------------|----------|
| `bash/` | Linux / macOS (Bash) | `.sh` scripts for building and running the container |
| `Windows/` | Windows PowerShell | `.ps1` equivalents of the same scripts |

---

## What the Scripts Do

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Create a temporary build context and dynamically write a `Dockerfile` |
| 2 | Build a Docker image that installs Bash, Vim, cURL, and Apache with SSL |
| 3 | Serve a demo web page inside the container |
| 4 | Auto-generate a quantum-safe certificate on first run using `dilithium3` and `mlkem768` |
| 5 | Drop user into an interactive shell with OpenSSL PQC tools ready |
| 6 | Expose ports `8080` (HTTP) and `8443` (HTTPS) to the host |

---

## Requirements

### Linux/macOS
- Docker installed and running
- Bash (`/bin/bash`)
- `curl` (optional for testing container output)

### Windows
- Docker Desktop (WSL2 backend recommended)
- PowerShell 7+ recommended (compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1)
- Execution policy may need to be changed:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
````

---

## Usage

### On Linux/macOS

```bash
cd bash
chmod +x 1.sh
./1.sh
```

Or run the fully commented version:

```bash
./2.sh
```

---

### On Windows PowerShell

```powershell
cd Windows
.\1.ps1
```

Or the commented version:

```powershell
.\2.ps1
```

---

## After Container Starts

You should see a message such as:

```
Container ready. Try:
  openssl list -signature-algorithms | grep -i dilithium
  curl -k https://localhost:8443
```

Then you will be inside a Bash shell inside the container.

### Test Dilithium support in OpenSSL

```bash
openssl list -signature-algorithms | grep -i dilithium
```

### Test the HTTPS endpoint from the host system

```bash
curl -k https://localhost:8443
```

Expected output:

```html
<h1>Quantum-Safe Dev Environment</h1>
<p>OpenSSL + Apache + ML-KEM + Dilithium</p>
```

---

## About the Post-Quantum Certificate

The container generates a new hybrid certificate on each fresh run, using:

* Dilithium3 (signature)
* ML-KEM-768 (key encapsulation)
* Valid for 1 day (`-days 1`)
* Self-signed (`-x509`)

This enables experimentation with PQC-ready TLS stacks, browsers, proxies, and related tools.

---

## Cleanup

The scripts automatically remove the temporary build folder after exit.

To remove the built image manually:

```bash
docker rmi oqs-dev
```

## Roadmap (optional enhancements)

* Add `docker-compose.yml` for optional persistent volumes
* Add flag for "no cleanup" debugging mode
* Add CI workflow (GitHub Actions) to auto-build image
* Add option to enable PQC-TLS in Apache config (port 8443)
* Add Wireshark instructions for PQC handshake visibility
